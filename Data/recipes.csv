They are by no means your store bought pickles.  They are even better then your favorite deli's pickles.  These pickles are what all other pickles are founded on; quality.  
DO NOT be scared of making pickles.  This is easy, and I will give it to you in layman's terms.  
In a good authentic Kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  None, not a drop.  What kind of pickle has no vinegar?  A good one.  Think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.  
How long is the process?  5 days, from start to finish.  Too many for you?  Then its time to move on.  Want a fantastic, authentic, Kosher/Jewish pickles?  You have found your recipe.  
Let us begin.

I also boil the cap just in case, but have made many batches without ever using boiling water and I have never taken ill.

Wash the jar or sterilize it so it no longer stinks like the vinegar they used to make there inferior pickles.', ""Now it gets real easy.  Pack as many of your pickles into the jar as you can.  Use the rest for a salad or something.  stick in all the dill (you can chop it, but it does not matter), all the garlic cloves, all the seeds, then stop, and look at your beautiful jar. If you have the grape leaves, stick them in at this time.  I don't ever use them, but my buddy does."", 'Pour the salt water in the jar.  All the way up to the top minus an inch, or a half inch or so.  If you are short water, add some.', 'Tightly cover the jar with the lid that came on the giant pickle jar.

Put a plate under the jar to see if it leaks.', ""The next day (24 hours later) check to see if the jar leaked.  If it did, it means you didn't follow my instructions.  Tighten the lid (if needed) and TURN IT UPRIGHT, cover it with the towel, and ignore it. Walk away."", 'Leave in cool dark place for five days.

Add the onion and mushrooms and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked and the onions are soft and translucent.  Drain of any excess fat.

533,Traditional (Real Deal) French Bread,"4 simple ingredients make up this rustic but flavourful, lovely bread.

Set aside.', '2)In a Large Bowl, mix well 4 C Flour and 1 T. salt. (to prevent the yeast coming in direct contact with the salt.).', ""3) Pour Yeast mix into the Flour mix, Using a wooden spoon, stir, add an additional 1 to 1 1/2 C Luke warm water until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (doesn't take long for this to happen and the dough forms a clumpy mass.)."", ""4)Lightly flour your work surface, and dump out to knead. Knead for about 1-2 minutes, or until you get a recognizable ball. (this is not your main Kneading point, so don't fuss over it!) Let the dough now rest while you clean up your bowl you will now use to let the dough ferment inches (about 5-6 minutes rest time)."", '5) Once your bowl is clean and dry (wiped clean) You now will need to start the Kneading process. Here, there are two methods you can take Fast, or Slow. What is the difference between the two? Texture/Crumb.', 'Method 1: Fast- Knead your usual way by doing quarter turns for 3-8 minutes, forming a nice elastic and smooth ball. Place Ball in your Large bowl and cover with Plastic. Let Rise for 90-120 minutes.', 'Method 2: Slow/Slap Bench: Begin to knead your dough, but this technique will be somewhat different than your typical quarter turn kneading. With this, the dough is flattened out slightly, then roughly fold dough into a single book fold ((Fold onto the second third and last third onto the second third)), held at one end (dough shape will be oblong) and slapped down on the work surface. Refolded and repeated about 850 times. YES 850! lol Once this is accomplished, dough is rounded into a ball and placed within the bowl to rise. 90-120 minutes, covered with plastic. (while this sounds outlandish, this is the traditional method and the texture is UN-BE-Leavable.) I also find that this method is less tiresome than normal kneading.', '6) Now that the dough has fermented, we can begin to form our loaves. Turn Dough out onto your kneading surface and flatten with your hands (by a smacking action) expelling all the gasses out of the dough. Divide into two equal parts. Round each piece into a ball, Rest for 5 minutes.', ""7)Prepare a Couche (A couche can be made by using a piece of linen or Towel, non-terry-cloth usually a little bigger than a tea-towel, which has had flour generously smoothed into the fabric to fill any creases and crevices of the towel used.) Set up your towel up to cradle your loaves. (This step isn't needed, but it helps to support the dough as it rises and gives a less flat result.)."", '8)Taking one portion, flatten out with your hands expelling all gasses. Take the top and fold down 2/3rds onto the dough, using the heal of your hand, seal the dough onto itself. Repeat fold and seal again. Fold down once more, but fold down to the bottom this time, sealing the top to the bottom.', '9)Lastly, taper off the ends of the dough by rolling your hands at the ends lighly with a bit of pressure to form a classic French Bread look. (at this point you can continue to roll your hands down the length of the dough to make a baguette rather than taper the ends).', '10) Place your dough seal side down onto your couche, leaving a bit of space for the loaves to expand between the two, yet still giving it support.', '11) Gash 3 cuts into the top of the loaves. Cover with the rest of the towel and Let rise an hour.', ""12) Gently peal the couche back from the loaves and GENTLY place them on either a baking sheet or a (lightly floured) paddle for placing onto baking stone. (Many would be tempted to use corn meal to prevent sticking, but that then takes it out of the 4 Ingredient Rule, making it untraditional French Bread.) You do not want to be rough, as you don't want them to deflate."", '13) Brush the tops of the risen dough with cool water using a pastry brush.', '14) Cooking: Toss 1/2 Cup water into the bottom of the Hot Preheated Oven 425 (Beware! Steam is HOT! BE CAREFUL) Place loaves in the oven and close. Turn the oven down to 350 and bake for 28-30 minutes.', '15) Bread is done when the bottoms sound hollow when tapped and the loaves are a rich almost dark golden colour.', ""16) For more information on the extensive technique used: Google French Bread Julia Child and view video's available.

With a golden layer of puff pastry topped by caramelized onions, soft potatoes, bacon and tangy Reblochon cheese, this tart is lighter than the sum of its parts, making for a satisfying fall dish that’s great any time of day. The Reblochon, a washed-rind cheese from France, can be replaced with a robust Taleggio from northern Italy or the smooth French soft-ripened cow’s-milk cheese Saint-Andre. Wine suggestions: the earthy, berry-rich flavors of Pinot Noirs from California’s Santa Lucia Highlands work well as partners for washed-rind cheeses like the Reblochon in this tart. Jason Miller likes to pour the silky 2005 Logan Pinot Noir.

Add the butter and sprigs of thyme to the pan and spoon the melted butter over the surface of the steak for another 2 minutes.', ""Place the skillet in the hot oven for about 2 minutes. Then check the temperature with a meat thermometer. The center of the steak should read 120 degrees for medium rare. Continue to cook in the oven until 120 degrees is reached.

Serve mushrooms either on top, or on the side of the steak.', 'TIPS:', 'Choose a bone-in Ribeye or Top Sirloin or Filet, and be sure the label says USDA Choice or Prime cut. A cut labeled Select will not give you a good result. Your steak should have a nice marbling of fat throughout.', 'DO NOT use regular table salt, it will be too salty. Kosher salt or sea salt works great.', ""If you can't find whole button mushrooms in a can or jar, you can use sliced. I have tried using fresh mushrooms, but the flavor is not the same.

If you don't own at least one good cast iron skillet, consider investing in one. It really does make a difference. If you don't have one, you can use a regular skillet, just make sure it's large enough to fit the whole steak and deep enough to avoid splattering oil on you.

875,Curry Powder Trio (Take Yer Pick!),"Three curry powder mixtures. British manufacturers developed curry powders in an attempt to provide a ready-made spice mixture equivalent to the kari podi (podi means “powder”) that British colonists became accustomed to in southern India. Essential to the fiery cooking of southern India, sambar podi is the combination of spices that evolved into British-style curry powder. Poudre de Colombo came to the French West Indies with Sri Lankans who were taken there to work on the sugar plantations. Japanese curry powder, under the S&B brand, has been produced since 1923, when Minejiro Yamazaki began blending a well-balanced and sweetly aromatic curry powder especially suited to Japanese tastes. For all curry powders, starting with whole spices and lightly toasting them before grinding yields a more fragrant, fresher mixture. *** NOTE *** Columbo is a French version of curry powder, which originated with the Sri Lankan indentured workers in the FWI. it does not carry the heat of many of the other islands. This mixture carries off-beat ingredients such as roasted rice. Roasting gives the rice a nutty flavor and makes it easier to grind. The rice acts as both a flavoring and a natural thickener. Poudre de Columbo makes a great holiday Gift, being one of the lesser-known cuisines of the Caribbean. You also can use it as you would any curry powder.",1,"['To make sambar podi -- Combine 3 tablespoons ground coriander; 3 tablespoons besan (chickpea) flour; 1 tablespoon ground cumin; 1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper; 1 teaspoon each salt, ground fenugreek seeds, amchur powder, dry mustard, and hot red chile powder; 1/2 teaspoon each ground cinnamon and turmeric; 8 crumbled dried curry leaves; and 1/4 teaspoon asafetida.

Makes about 3/4 cup.', 'To make poudre de Colombo -- Toast 1/4 cup white rice in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking frequently, until light brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and cool. In the same skillet, toast 1/4 cup cumin seeds; 1/4 cup coriander seeds; 1 tablespoon each black mustard seeds, black peppercorns, and fenugreek seeds; and 1 teaspoon whole cloves until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes.

986,Hidden Delights Lasagna,"I created this myself after looking at a few recipes... my attempt was to get more veggies and soy and make it lower calorie at the same time. I was happy with how this turned out... especially the cheese mixture. No one will know it is soy! The end result isn't as rich as the original version but still quite filling. If you aren't worried about calories you could double the mozzarella and use sausage with the ground beef. You will get 1-2 veggie servings per slice (depending on how much you count as a serving).
I made this in 2 8x8 pans... make one now and freeze one for later. Or half the recipe. Also this could be made vegetarian by replacing the meat with a veggie alternative and made lactose free if you omit the parmesan and replace the mozzarella with rice cheese.",12,"['Saute the onion, garlic and summer squash until slightly softened.

988,Resveratrol Crunch-N-Munch,"The French Paradox,,,the observation that the French suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease even though having a diet pretty rich in saturated fats.  It is thought that their saving grace is coming from all the red wine that they drink.  Red wine contains resveratrol, a natural substance that has been linked to the prevention of many diseases including cancer and also to healthy life expansion.
I love red wine but I also wanted to see what other foods contain large amounts of the stuff!!  Surprisingly, peanuts!!  I decided to put together a trek mix using some of the tasty resveratrol winners!!!
I find that I enjoy a mix of fruits and nuts with a little salt and a treat like chocolate rather than just a bowl of just nuts or just fruit.  I used salted peanuts to give this mix that hint of salt and balance but you can definitely use raw peanuts along with all of these other raw ingredients.  I hope you like the mix!",20,"['Rinse your fruit and dry it completely on soft kitchen towels.
