0,416,2,2023-06-14,"Served this recipe from Williams-Sonoma last night for dinner.  It was so good!!  I made the mistake of using leftover hamburger buns instead of following the directions of using sourdough rolls, which would have stood up better to the sauce, resulting in a soggy burger.  This did not affect the wonderful taste, I just would not make this mistake again.  I used an 18-year old balsamic vinegar from Fustini's in this dish and it was wonderful.  I also used my grill pan instead of the BBQ owing to the weather.  It worked well.  According to the recipe, the sandwiches can be served warm (which we did) or chilled.  Prep time includes marinating time.",6,"['In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, garlic, shallots, salt and pepper.  Arrange the mushroom caps in a single layer in a shallow, nonreactive dish.  Pour half the marinade over the mushrooms and reserve the remainder.  Cover and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, turning after 30 minutes.', 'Prepare a fire in a grill.  Lightly oil the grill rack.  When the coals are hot, remove the mushrooms from the marinade, place on the grill rack and weigh with a large fry pan.  Grill the mushrooms until tender and seared on both sides, about 4 minutes total.', 'Drizzle about 1 Tb of the reserved marinade on each roll half.  Place a mushroom on the bottom half of each roll.  Sprinkle the top half with goat cheese, then cover with sun-dried tomatoes and basil leaves.  Place the halves together.  Secure each sandwich with toothpicks, cut in half, and wrap in aluminum foil.  Keep chilled until ready to serve.']",72,8,"The Portobello Mushroom and Goat Cheese Sandwiches was quite good, though I made some adjustments to suit my taste."

(doesn't take long for this to happen and the dough forms a clumpy mass.)."", ""4)Lightly flour your work surface, and dump out to knead. Knead for about 1-2 minutes, or until you get a recognizable ball. (this is not your main Kneading point, so don't fuss over it!) Let the dough now rest while you clean up your bowl you will now use to let the dough ferment inches (about 5-6 minutes rest time)."", '5) Once your bowl is clean and dry (wiped clean) You now will need to start the Kneading process. Here, there are two methods you can take Fast, or Slow. What is the difference between the two? Texture/Crumb.', 'Method 1: Fast- Knead your usual way by doing quarter turns for 3-8 minutes, forming a nice elastic and smooth ball. Place Ball in your Large bowl and cover with Plastic. Let Rise for 90-120 minutes.', 'Method 2: Slow/Slap Bench: Begin to knead your dough, but this technique will be somewhat different than your typical quarter turn kneading. With this, the dough is flattened out slightly, then roughly fold dough into a single book fold ((Fold onto the second third and last third onto the second third)), held at one end (dough shape will be oblong) and slapped down on the work surface. Refolded and repeated about 850 times. YES 850! lol Once this is accomplished, dough is rounded into a ball and placed within the bowl to rise. 90-120 minutes, covered with plastic.

Take the top and fold down 2/3rds onto the dough, using the heal of your hand, seal the dough onto itself. Repeat fold and seal again. Fold down once more, but fold down to the bottom this time, sealing the top to the bottom.', '9)Lastly, taper off the ends of the dough by rolling your hands at the ends lighly with a bit of pressure to form a classic French Bread look. (at this point you can continue to roll your hands down the length of the dough to make a baguette rather than taper the ends).', '10) Place your dough seal side down onto your couche, leaving a bit of space for the loaves to expand between the two, yet still giving it support.', '11) Gash 3 cuts into the top of the loaves.

DO NOT be scared of making pickles.  This is easy, and I will give it to you in layman's terms.  
In a good authentic Kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  None, not a drop.  What kind of pickle has no vinegar?  A good one.  Think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.

British manufacturers developed curry powders in an attempt to provide a ready-made spice mixture equivalent to the kari podi (podi means “powder”) that British colonists became accustomed to in southern India. Essential to the fiery cooking of southern India, sambar podi is the combination of spices that evolved into British-style curry powder. Poudre de Colombo came to the French West Indies with Sri Lankans who were taken there to work on the sugar plantations. Japanese curry powder, under the S&B brand, has been produced since 1923, when Minejiro Yamazaki began blending a well-balanced and sweetly aromatic curry powder especially suited to Japanese tastes. For all curry powders, starting with whole spices and lightly toasting them before grinding yields a more fragrant, fresher mixture. *** NOTE *** Columbo is a French version of curry powder, which originated with the Sri Lankan indentured workers in the FWI. it does not carry the heat of many of the other islands. This mixture carries off-beat ingredients such as roasted rice. Roasting gives the rice a nutty flavor and makes it easier to grind. The rice acts as both a flavoring and a natural thickener. Poudre de Columbo makes a great holiday Gift, being one of the lesser-known cuisines of the Caribbean. You also can use it as you would any curry powder.",1,"['To make sambar podi -- Combine 3 tablespoons ground coriander; 3 tablespoons besan (chickpea) flour; 1 tablespoon ground cumin; 1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper; 1 teaspoon each salt, ground fenugreek seeds, amchur powder, dry mustard, and hot red chile powder; 1/2 teaspoon each ground cinnamon and turmeric; 8 crumbled dried curry leaves; and 1/4 teaspoon asafetida.

Take the top and fold down 2/3rds onto the dough, using the heal of your hand, seal the dough onto itself. Repeat fold and seal again. Fold down once more, but fold down to the bottom this time, sealing the top to the bottom.', '9)Lastly, taper off the ends of the dough by rolling your hands at the ends lighly with a bit of pressure to form a classic French Bread look.

While it didn't harden like a praline, it was just simply too thick.  I've adjusted the quantities of milk and powdered sugar in order to have a filling that is spreadable.  After it cools, you may need to thin it with a little more evaporated milk.  If it's too thick start adding one tablespoon at a time until you get a consistency that can easily be spread on a cake without tearing the cake.  You are looking for a consistency that will slowly drip off of your mixing spoon.  There are other recipes for praline fillings that aren't cooked.  However, I find that the cooking of the mixture adds extra flavor and a richness that will not achieve by just mixing the ingredients together.

If I had to actually narrow it down to just one reason, it would be tough, but smoking corn on the cob is definitely in the top five.  The kernels keep their sweetness, which is intensified by smoking, and their crunch and juiciness.  Stripped from the cob-a very simple procedure-the kernels are an amazing
addition to all kinds of salads, soups, and salsas.  When it comes to the most bang for the buck, smoked corn is leader of the pack.  Use the milder wood chips like alder or cherry, or go for the obvious, corn cob chips.  Hickory and Mesquite are quite good also.
